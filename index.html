			Jan-wack Inc. takes care of any unused nuclear waste products from your local nuclear power plant 
			and disposes of them in the Pacific Ocean, where they are unlikely to be found. This, to us, is a 
			win-win situation for everyone. As a power plant owner, you don't have to worry about your radioactive 
			debris, and we don't have to worry about potentially harming the environment in the foreseeable future. 
			Our professional environmental activist, Sofonias Andrew, believes that the planet will eventually 
			recover somehow, and With the help of Jay-B, a self-proclaimed expert in nuclear waste science, we believe
			that a better future for nuclear waste is possible.
